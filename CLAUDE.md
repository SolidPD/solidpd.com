## 🔴 CRITICAL: Production Safety Rules

> **⚠️ THE `main` BRANCH IS THE LIVE PRODUCTION SITE**
>
> Merging to `main` immediately deploys to https://solidpd.com - the client's live website.

### NEVER Do These Actions Without Explicit User Request

| Action | Allowed? | Requirement |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Merge PR to `main` | 🚫 NEVER autonomous | User must explicitly say "merge to main" or "deploy to production" |
| Create PR targeting `main` | 🚫 NEVER autonomous | User must explicitly request PR to main |
| Push directly to `main` | 🚫 NEVER | Always blocked, even if requested |
| `git checkout main` + commit | 🚫 NEVER | Work on feature branches only |
| `netlify deploy --prod` | 🚫 NEVER autonomous | User must explicitly request production deploy |

### When User Requests Merge to Main

**STOP and present this warning BEFORE proceeding:**

```
⚠️  PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT WARNING ⚠️

You are about to merge to the `main` branch.
This will IMMEDIATELY deploy changes to the LIVE production site:

  🌐 https://solidpd.com

This action will affect the client's live website visible to the public.

Please confirm you want to proceed with production deployment.
```

**Only proceed after user confirms.**

### Safe Workflow

1. **Always work on feature branches** (e.g., `ms-cc-dev-multipage-v2`)
2. **Deploy previews** using `netlify deploy --dir=.` (without `--prod`)
3. **Create PRs to `dev` branch** for staging/review
4. **Only merge to `main`** when user explicitly requests production deployment

### Why This Matters

- `main` branch triggers automatic production deployment via GitHub Actions
- There is NO staging environment between merge and live site
- Mistakes affect the client's business immediately
- Rollback requires manual intervention

## Project Overview

**Solid Product Design** - Static website for a hardware product design and engineering services company based in Philadelphia, PA. Currently a single-page splash site being expanded to a multi-page website based on client mockups.

**Live Site**: https://solidpd.com
**Netlify Admin**: https://app.netlify.com/projects/solidpd

## Development Commands

```bash
# Local development (choose one)
python -m http.server 8000
npx serve .
netlify dev                    # Netlify CLI with form support

# Deploy preview (generates unique URL for review)
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=$(grep NETLIFY_API_KEY .env | cut -d'=' -f2)
netlify deploy --dir=.

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --dir=. --prod
```

## Deployment Workflow

- **Branch `main`** → Production deploy to solidpd.com (via GitHub Actions)
- **Branch `dev`** → Preview deploy (via GitHub Actions)
- **Branch `ms-cc-dev-multipage`** → Sandbox branch, manual `netlify deploy` for previews
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Architecture | Multi-page static HTML (transitioning from single-page) |
| Build system | Zero-dependency (no npm/build step) |
| Contact form | Netlify Forms |
| Labs page | Placeholder (external link TBD) |
| Styling | Inline CSS in each HTML file |

## Design System

**Brand Guide**: `docs/solidpd-brand-guide-v1.0.pdf` (official reference)

**Colors** (from brand guide):
- **Primary Blue**: `#0495F6` (accent, links, CTA)
- **Primary Yellow/Orange**: `#FFB75A` (accent, stylized O)
- **Grays**: `#1A1A1A` (90%) → `#E5E5E5` (10%)
- **Dark Blues**: `#011A2B` → `#CAE9FE` (for depth)

**Typography**:
- **Headings**: Quicksand, Semibold 600, UPPERCASE, ≥2x body size
- **Body**: DM Sans, Regular 400 / Bold 700
- **Logo font**: Quicksand variable (weights 350, 500, 550)

**Logo Rules**:
- Min width: 60px (screen), 0.75" (print)
- Clear space: 0.5x height of stylized O
- Stylized O may be blue or yellow; letters always black or white

**Breakpoints**: 768px (tablet), 480px (mobile), 667px height (small screens)

## Mockups

Source mockups in `mockups/` folder (PDF, PPTX, SVG formats). 15-page design specifying:
- **Pages**: Home, About, Services (flip cards), Work (portfolio), Contact (form), CTA sections
- **Navigation**: Work | About | Services | Contact | Labs
- **Interactive elements**: Service cards flip on hover, portfolio items reveal details

## Planned Page Structure

```
/                   → index.html (hero + value prop)
/about              → about.html (story + 4 pillars)
/services           → services.html (6 service cards)
/work               → work.html (portfolio grid)
/contact            → contact.html (Netlify form + location)
```

## Assets

- **Logos**: `images/logo-horizontal-white.png`, `images/logo-stacked-white.png`
- **Client assets** (`images/assets/`):
  - Hero Image, Our Work images (Neuralert, Laminitis Sensor, UroGenie)
  - `Other Images/` - Service/process photos (14 images)
  - `Client Logos (incomplete)/` - Only 3 logos; use placeholders for rest
- **Placeholders** (`images/placeholders/`): 40 images from mockups (see `ASSET_MANIFEST.md`)
  - Use for missing client logos and as visual reference
